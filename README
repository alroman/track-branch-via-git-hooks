Tracking branch via git hooks

Reference: http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/

This script will respond to the JSON that github sends after a commit in a repo.
Then it will look at the branch that a commit was made and if it is a specified
branch the script will then perform a sudo to do a request pull as a specified
user for a specified local git repo.

Then the git committer and specified admin will receive an email with the output
of the git pull and some details from the commit.
